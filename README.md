# password-store

My password store for pass. This should stay private.

Took inspiration from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/abtrout/d64fb11ad6f9f49fa325).

I'm using [pass-git-helper](https://github.com/languitar/pass-git-helper) as credential store for git. Follow instruction on its README to configure properly git configs and username extraction.
